Instead, please send an email to: **security@[yourdomain].com**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours
- **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability within 72 hours
- **Timeline**: We'll provide regular updates every 48-72 hours during investigation
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be patched within 7 days, others within 30 days

### Security Measures in Place

Our application implements multiple layers of security:

#### Data Protection
- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- ✅ **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- ✅ **Token Security**: Plaid access tokens encrypted with separate keys
- ✅ **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds

#### Access Controls
- ✅ **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with secure session management
- ✅ **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints protected against abuse
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated

#### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- ✅ **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Regular Updates**: Weekly security patch cycle
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Complete security event tracking

#### Privacy & Compliance
- ✅ **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary financial data
- ✅ **Consent Management**: Clear user consent for data processing
- ✅ **Data Retention**: Automated deletion policies
- ✅ **User Rights**: Data export and deletion on request

### Security Practices

#### For Developers
- All code changes require security review
- Dependencies are regularly updated and scanned
- Secrets are never committed to version control
- Production access requires multi-factor authentication

#### For Users
- Enable two-factor authentication on your account
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Keep your browser and devices updated

### Bug Bounty Program

While we don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program, we greatly appreciate security researchers who help us maintain the security of our platform. We may offer recognition and small rewards for significant security findings.
